## Architecture & Design Patterns

### **Component Architecture**
- **MediaPickerSheet**: Reusable, can be used in Status upload feature
- **MediaPreviewModal**: Full-screen modal with upload logic
- **MediaPlayerModal**: Universal media player for all types
- **MessageBubble**: Updated to render media with tap handlers

### **State Management**
- Local state in chat/[id].tsx for UI state
- AppContext `sendChatMessage()` handles message creation
- Storage service handles uploads
- ChatService handles database operations
- Supabase Realtime syncs across users

### **Design System Compliance**
- BlurView with `intensity={80-100}`, `tint="dark"`
- Glass backgrounds: `rgba(30, 30, 35, 0.4)`
- Borders: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`
- Accent color: `#F50057` (pink/red)
- Spring animations throughout
- Haptic feedback on interactions

### **Error Handling**
- Permission checks before camera/gallery access
- Try-catch blocks around upload operations
- User alerts for network failures
- Graceful cancellation handling
- Fallback data URI if storage fails
